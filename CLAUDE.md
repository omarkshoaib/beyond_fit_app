# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Beyond Fit App** is a "Deterministic Coaching Engine" — a backend system that algorithmically generates personalized weekly workout plans and delivers them to clients via a Telegram bot with a human-in-the-loop (HITL) admin approval step before dispatch.

## Commands

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Run the FastAPI server
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Run the Telegram bot
```bash
python -m app.bot
```

### Run all tests
```bash
pytest
```

### Run a single test
```bash
pytest tests/test_generator.py::test_generate_end_to_end
```

## Architecture

### Two entry points, one engine

The system has two separate entry points that share the core generation logic:

1. **FastAPI server** (`app/main.py` + `app/routes.py`) — REST API exposing `/generate` and `/generate_and_coach` endpoints. Used for testing/integration.
2. **Telegram bot** (`app/bot.py`) — The primary production interface. Runs as a standalone polling process (not mounted on FastAPI).

Both call `WorkoutGenerator` from `app/generator.py` directly.

### Core generation pipeline (`app/generator.py`)

`WorkoutGenerator.generate()` is the central engine. It is **entirely deterministic** (no randomness):

1. `_resolve_split()` — maps `(avatar, training_days)` to named day templates (e.g., `["Upper", "Lower", "Push", "Pull", "Legs"]`)
2. `_budget_volume()` — sets weekly set caps per muscle group based on `experience_level` (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
3. `_calculate_rpe()` — returns the target RPE for the week using a fixed 5-week block cycle (weeks 1–4 ascending, week 5 = deload at RPE 6)
4. `_fill_slots()` — builds each training day by filling 3 slots: main lift (highest fatigue, pattern-matched), primary accessory, isolation (with biomechanical synergy pairing). Respects a `MAX_FATIGUE = 12` per-day cap.
5. `AutoRegulator.calculate_next_load()` — when prior week telemetry exists (`actual_weight`, `actual_rpe`), computes the next week's `target_weight` using RPE error correction (4% per RPE point) + progressive overload increment.

Exercise selection uses `_filter_exercises()` which gates on: `avatar_tags`, `available_equipment`, `limitations` (currently only `lower_back_pain` is handled), and optional kwargs (`pattern`, `primary_muscle`, `muscle_group`, `bio_focus`, `fatigue_cost` range).

### Database (`app/database.py` + `app/models.py`)

Uses **SQLModel** (SQLAlchemy + Pydantic hybrid). Defaults to SQLite (`coaching_engine.db`) but switches to PostgreSQL if `DATABASE_URL` env var is set.

Persisted tables (post Phase A SaaS refactor):
- `ClientProfile` — one row per client. **Two parallel coach concepts coexist:**
  - **Bot:** `assigned_coach_id` (BigInteger) → `CoachProfile.telegram_user_id`. Drives plan-DM routing, /review scope, /override scope. Set when a paid client picks a coach.
  - **Web (FastAPI):** legacy `coach_id` (str) + `is_coach`/`is_admin` flags. Used by `app/api/*`. The bot does **not** consult these. Kept in parallel to preserve the FastAPI surface.
- `CoachProfile` — bot-side coach record (CV upload, status workflow, telegram_user_id PK).
- `Subscription` / `Payment` / `AccessCode` / `ChatBinding` / `ReminderLog` — paid-SaaS plumbing.
- `WorkoutHistory` — one row per completed week; `workout_json` stores the full `WorkoutWeek` as a JSON string (including `actual_weight`/`actual_rpe` filled in during check-in).
- `PendingApproval` — staging table for plans awaiting coach/admin review; deleted after approve/reject.

**`client_id`** is now an opaque `cl_<token>` string generated at pay_verify time — **not** a stringified Telegram user id. Chat → client resolution goes through `ChatBinding(chat_id BigInteger PK → client_id)`. See `auth_roles.get_authenticated_client(chat_id)`.

`WorkoutSlot`, `WorkoutDay`, `WorkoutWeek` are **not** database tables — they exist only as nested JSON inside `WorkoutHistory.workout_json`.

### Telegram bot flow (`app/bot.py`)

Three `ConversationHandler` state machines:

1. **Client intake** (`/start`): collects avatar → days → experience → limitations → email, creates `ClientProfile`, calls `run_generation_and_dispatch()`
2. **Check-in** (`/checkin`): iterates over unlogged `main_lift` slots in the latest `WorkoutHistory`, collects `actual_weight` + `actual_rpe` per slot; when all slots filled, increments `week_number` and re-runs generation with prior week as input
3. **Admin flow**: triggered by approve/reject inline keyboard callbacks sent to `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID`. Approve → PDF generation → email dispatch → move to `WorkoutHistory`. Reject → admin types free-text feedback → `FlashCommunicationService.apply_coach_edits()` mutates the JSON via LLM → re-presents for approval.

### Services (`app/services/`)

- **`llm_service.py`** — `FlashCommunicationService` wraps OpenRouter (via `openai` SDK with custom `base_url`). Uses `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`. Two methods: `generate_coaching_message()` (formats workout as client email) and `apply_coach_edits()` (mutates workout JSON per admin feedback, must return raw JSON only).
- **`pdf_service.py`** — converts Markdown coaching message to PDF bytes via `markdown2` + `weasyprint`.
- **`email_service.py`** — SMTP dispatch of the PDF to the client's email.

### Exercise database (`app/exercise_db.py`)

A single large in-memory list of exercise dicts (`EXPANDED_EXERCISES_DATA`). Each entry has: `exercise_id`, `name`, `movement_pattern`, `primary_muscle`, `secondary_muscles`, `fatigue_cost` (1–5), `equipment_required`, `avatar_tags` (`powerlifter`/`powerbuilder`/`gen_pop`), `biomechanical_focus` (`lengthened_position`/`shortened_position`/`mid_range`).

## Key design constraints

- The workout plan is **always generated deterministically first** — the LLM only formats it into a readable email and optionally mutates it on admin rejection. The LLM never selects exercises. On rejection, `apply_coach_edits()` validates the LLM output as a real `WorkoutWeek` before it can overwrite a live plan.
- `_fill_slots()` sets `slot_type` per slot index: `main_compound` (slot 0), `secondary_compound` (slot 1), `isolation` (rest). The check-in flow keys off `main_compound`/`secondary_compound`.
- A powerlifter's accessory/isolation slots draw from the powerbuilder exercise pool (only the competition main lift stays powerlifter-only), so the narrow powerlifter pool no longer collapses days to thin sets.
- Weekly volume budget is split per-day across the days that train each muscle, so repeated day-types (e.g. 6-day PPL) get symmetric volume.
- `AutoRegulator.calculate_next_load()` is clamped to ±10% per week.
- Nutrition is **halal-only** (no non-halal foods stocked; no religious filter) with a **single balanced diet style**; low-carb is goal-integrated (fat-loss leans lower-carb), not a separate style. See the audit report (`AUDIT_REPORT.md`) and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-06-audit-hardening.md`.
- `CoachedWorkoutResponse.workout` matches the route's `workout=` return; `test_api.py` authenticates and does not assert a `client_id` on the workout. (The previous three bullets here were stale — corrected 2026-06-06.)
- Declared limitations are honored in exercise selection: `SUBSTITUTION_MAP`
  (`app/domain/workout/constants.py`) bans unsafe movement patterns
  (`knee_pain`→squat/lunge, `shoulder_impingement`→overhead/upright-row,
  `lower_back_pain`→hinge **and back-loaded squat**) in `_filter_exercises`, with a
  last-resort Tier-5 substitution in `_select_for_slot` so a day is never emptied.
  `wrist_pain`/`hip_flexor_tightness` add a coaching caveat (`INJURY_CAVEATS`), not an
  exclusion. NOTE: `lower_back_pain` now also restricts squat (was hinge-only) — a
  behavior expansion, clinically intended.
- Week-1 working loads are seeded from optional intake baselines (squat/bench/deadlift
  → Brzycki e1RM → Tuchscherer RPE/%1RM, rounded down) via
  `app/domain/workout/loadseed.py`; the prior-week autoregulator takes precedence from
  week 2, and skipped baselines fall back to rep+RPE guidance.
- Meal plans rotate per day (`build_day_plan(day_index=...)`) so a 7-day plan draws
  varied foods, not the same foods every day (the >5×/week cap still applies on top).
- Each generated nutrition day is gated by `validate_day`; residual drift is
  non-blocking and surfaced in the plan `rationale` ("[macro drift]") for the coach.
  The fat check is grounded in the AMDR (fat ≤ 35% of energy), not a tight band around
  the design target.
- Equipment is collected at intake (preset menu + 15-item checklist + an explicit
  pull-up-bar question on the bodyweight path) and editable via `/update_profile` →
  Equipment, replacing the old hardcoded `["full_gym"]`. The pure module
  `app/domain/workout/equipment.py` holds the vocabulary, presets, `floor_equipment`
  (an empty selection floors to `["bodyweight"]` — an empty list would make the
  generator emit a zero-exercise plan), and `validate_equipment`/`equipment_alternatives`.
  A legacy/empty `available_equipment` row is treated as `full_gym` at generation
  (`_filter_exercises`). Intake supports **back navigation** (forward-replay: Back one
  step, re-tap forward; `handle_intake_back` + `_intake_predecessor`); confirm handlers
  are idempotent so replay never leaves stale flags.
- Coach exercise-adds are equipment-guarded by `validate_equipment` on all three
  `PendingApproval.workout_json` write paths: `/override` is checked at set-time (reject
  + alternatives), the reject LLM-edit is blocked before it can overwrite a plan, and the
  initial-generation write flags a mismatch on the coach DM. Add-core
  (`_core_choices_for_client`) was already equipment-filtered. A bodyweight-only client
  with no pull-up bar can train no pulling pattern — the coach approval DM flags this.
  Bodyweight floor exercises: `bw_air_squat`, `bw_reverse_lunge`, `bw_single_leg_rdl`,
  `bw_knee_push_up`, `bw_inverted_row_bar` (no regression metadata — that is SP-B). See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-20-spa-equipment-back-button-design.md`.
- Exercise selection is **ability-aware** (SP-B1): every exercise has a `difficulty_tier`
  (1–5, skill/strength — NOT fatigue; barbell compounds are ≥4 by a safety backstop in
  `exercise_db._default_tier`, incl. trap_bar/ez_bar). `app/domain/workout/ability.py`
  holds the 6 `LADDERS` (bodyweight→barbell), `client_ability` (per-family, NULL→experience
  default), `global_ability` (non-anchor scalar), and `ladder_rung` (highest tier ≤ ability,
  equipment-valid, floor = lowest rung). A 6-family intake survey sets
  `ClientProfile.exercise_ability` (Alembic 0021; experience defaults beginner=2 /
  intermediate=4 / advanced=4, so a no-survey intermediate still gets barbell mains).
  `_select_for_slot`: a **compound** anchor slot picks the ladder rung (re-validated against
  avatar + `lower_back_pain` secondary, since the ladder bypasses `_filter_exercises`);
  isolation slots keep their fatigue-bounded selection; the `max_difficulty` ceiling is
  threaded through **every** fallback tier and never dropped (so a beginner never gets an
  above-ability lift). Powerlifter competition mains are exempt (tier 5). A bodyweight main
  collects RPE (not weight) at check-in. Variation auto-progression over time is **SP-B2**
  (deferred). See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-20-spb1-ability-regressions-design.md`.
